# Progress so far
- looked at Lotta's file/script, realised that there still is a significant amount of ambiguity and it's not easily usable for my workflow - also, only ca. 50 percent of the entries were covered, the rest was ignored due to complexity
- explored the Abkürzungsverzeichnis to better understand the complexity
- created a plan for using the information in the glossary
    - expand all abbreviations where a simple rule suffices
    - let an LLM choose the most likely candidate for abbreviations where there are multiple candidates
    - then let an LLM normalise the text
- for this first the information in the glossary needs to be extracted, because it's definitely not yet in a form that can be used programatically
    - I decided to use a script for this, because this ensures reproducibility and makes all decisions I took explicit
    - in case I made a mistake somewhere (misunderstanding something about the glossary), it would also be easier to fix it, by fixing the script and re-running it
- got started on extracting the info (letting ChatGPT-5.4 create a first revision of a script for extracting the information for me)
    - since there is a lot of complexity behind the data and knowledge of Latin helps, using a model that is simply trained to programm, wouldn't have been as helpful, so I decided to use a commercial model for this task, which doesn't need to be reproducible (since the script itself ensures reproducibility)
- made some manual revisions on data in the glossary (there are a lot of inconsistencies and correcting some makes the extraction simpler)

# Format of the Wortstamm/Deklination columns
The columns were cleaned by `clean_morphology.py` (re-runnable; rows it cannot clean keep their values and are written to `data/morphology_review.csv`). `paradigm.py` generates the full set of inflected forms per candidate from these columns (`entry_forms(Auflösung, Wortstamm, Deklination)`), e.g. for validating inflected expansions.

**Wortstamm** — one part per word of the Auflösung, separated by `; `:
- declinable noun/adjective: `stem -ending` (genitive singular; genitive plural for plural-only words, which are marked `(Pl.)` in Deklination). Stem variants: `stem1/stem2 -ending`; alternative endings: `stem -e/-i`. `ae` is written `e` (the RG uses both spellings, treat them as interchangeable).
- verb: `present, perfect, supine` stems (`-` for a missing stem, variants with `/`)
- fixed word (not inflected, e.g. `et` or an attribute already in the genitive): the word itself, verbatim
- `?` = unknown; a trailing ` ?` marks a part as unverified

**Deklination** — one part per Wortstamm part, separated by `; `:
- nouns: `a`, `o`, `u`, `e`, `i`, `kons.`, `gem.` with optional `(m.)`, `(f.)`, `(n.)`, `(Pl.)` and `/`-alternatives when uncertain
- adjectives/participles: class plus `(Adj.)`, e.g. `o/a (Adj.)`, `i (Adj.)`
- verbs: `a-Konj.`, `e-Konj.`, `i-Konj.`, `kons.-Konj.`, `gem.-Konj.`, `halbkons.-Konj.`, optional `(Dep.)`
- other: `Gerundium`, `Gerundivum`, `Adverb`; `-` = fixed word; `?` = unknown; trailing ` ?` = unverified

# ToDos
- check that for all aliases the targets actually exist
- handle stuff (first understand what it means) like
    - `solutus/soluta`
    - alias of multiple things (siehe cap. und capel)
        - no alias entry or multiple entries
        - LLM_CANDIDATE
    - wieso hat Romanorum Imperator die Notiz "und ausgeschrieben: Romanum imperium; Romanum Imperium"?
